## Introduction
In this presentation I will be using the diamonds data to examine how the price varies
in function of quality and carat.

A plot will be made with ggplotly.

## Data selection
Because the large amount of data I will take a random sample.
```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
set.seed(13)
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste("Clarity:", clarity)), size = 4) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = cut, fill = cut)) + facet_wrap(~ cut)
```

## Plot
```{r}
ggplotly(p)
```
